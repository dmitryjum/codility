# Codility Code Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various Codility code challenges. Each challenge is organized into its own directory, which includes:

- **`solution.rb`**: The Ruby script containing my solution to the challenge.
- **`readme.md`**: A markdown file with the challenge description and any relevant notes or explanations.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal archive of my solutions to Codility challenges. It helps me track my progress and provides a reference for future problem-solving.

Feel free to explore the solutions and challenge descriptions. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
